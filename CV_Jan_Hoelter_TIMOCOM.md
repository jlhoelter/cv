## Profile

I work at the intersection of product leadership, organizational design, and technology in complex B2B environments.

Over the last years, I have built and led digital product organizations in contexts shaped by legacy systems, evolving governance, and high uncertainty. A core part of my work has been clarifying decision rights, aligning product strategy with business goals, and enabling teams to take ownership without constant escalation.

My focus is on structuring complexity rather than abstracting it away — making trade-offs explicit, improving decision quality, and creating conditions under which teams can deliver sustainable product outcomes.

## Experience

### **ABS Safety GmbH**

- Operated in a context where portfolio-level governance, investment decisions, and escalation mechanisms were still evolving, requiring strong alignment and expectation management.  
- Gained deep, hands-on experience with the limits of leadership in the absence of clear structural mandates, shaping a strong focus on decision frameworks, escalation logic, and portfolio prioritization as levers for sustainable product outcomes.  
- Led cross-functional teams under conditions of high uncertainty, balancing stability of the core business with exploration of new digital initiatives.
